## 🌐 What is Internet?

The Internet, as the name suggests, stands for **interconnected networks**—a global system of interconnected computers or computer networks. It enables large-scale data transfer and information exchange across the world.

## 🕰️ History of the Internet

The Internet started in the late 1960s with a project called **ARPANET**, made by the U.S. government to help researchers share information safely. In 1991, it became public with the launch of the **World Wide Web** by **Tim Berners-Lee**. It changed how people access and share information around the world.

## 🏠 How Does the Internet Reach Your Home?

- For **mobile networks**, the Internet is transmitted wirelessly through nearby cellular towers.  
- For **home broadband connections**, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) deliver internet access via optical fiber cables or telephone lines.  
- **Globally**, the Internet travels through underwater optic cables that stretch across oceans, carrying data between countries and continents.

## 🧠✨ Some Important Internet Jargons and Terminologies

| Term         | Brief Explanation |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Client**   | A device like a phone, tablet, or computer that asks for something from a server—like when your browser asks to open a website. |
| **Server**   | A computer or a powerful system that stores websites, apps, and files and sends them when clients ask for them. |
| **IP Address** | Internet Protocol Address is a unique number like an address for every device on the internet. It helps computers know where to send and receive data. |
| **DNS**      | Domain Name System is like a phonebook of the internet! It translates human-friendly domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1). |
| **ISP**      | Internet Service Providers are companies like Jio or Airtel that bring internet to your home. They also give your device an IP address. |
| **HTTP**     | Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a set of rules that decide how websites send and receive data. It’s how web pages reach your browser. |
| **HTTPS**    | A safer version of HTTP. It locks your data with encryption so that things like passwords stay private. |
| **TLS**      | Transport Layer Security is a security guard for your internet connection. It makes sure your chats with websites are safe and private. |
| **TCP**      | Transfer Control Protocol breaks your data into tiny packets, sends them in order, and rebuilds them correctly on the other side. |
| **URL**      | Uniform Resource Locator is the web address you type to open a website—like the internet’s version of a home address. |
| **Web Browser** | An app like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox that helps you visit and explore websites. |
| **Session**  | A temporary interaction between the user and a website or an app that lasts as long as the user is active. |
| **Cookies**  | Tiny memory units used by websites to remember your login status, language, or preferences. |
| **Header**   | Extra information sent with data on the internet—like labels on a package, telling what’s inside and how to handle it. |
| **Cache**    | A storage space that temporarily saves data so it can be quickly accessed later, speeding up websites and apps. |
| **Payload**  | The main content of a data packet—like the actual message, while the header is the label of the envelope containing the payload. |

## 🧭 What Happens When You Enter a URL in a Web Browser?

1. 🔗 You type a URL (like `https://www.example.com`) into your web browser.
2. 🧠 The browser checks if it already knows the IP address. If not, it sends a request to a DNS server (usually provided by your ISP) asking for the IP address of that domain.
3. 🌍 The DNS server looks up the domain name and replies with the correct IP address.
4. 🧑‍💻 Now your browser (acting as the client) uses that IP address to send a request to the website’s server.
5. 📡 This request travels through your ISP’s network, possibly across various routers and cables, to reach the destination server.
6. 📦 The request and response follow internet rules like HTTP/HTTPS and TCP, ensuring the message is delivered correctly and securely.
7. 🖥️ The server receives your request, processes it, and sends back the necessary data like the website’s code, text, and images.
8. 🌐 Your browser receives this data and displays the website on your screen — all of this usually happens in just a few seconds.
